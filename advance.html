                    Dončić was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia to Mirjam Poterbin, an owner of beauty salons,[3] and Saša Dončić, a basketball coach and former player.[4][5] His mother is Slovenian, and his father is a Slovenian of Serbian descent from Kosovo.[6][7][8] His parents filed for divorce in 2008, with custody and legal guardianship granted to his mother.[5][9]
                    According to his family, Dončić first touched a basketball when he was seven months old and was frequently playing with a miniature hoop in his room by the age of one.[4][10] He played various sports in his childhood, including football, which he later quit after growing too tall.[11] At age seven, he began playing organized basketball at primary school in Ljubljana.[10][12] His opponents at the time were up to ten years old, as Dončić reflected: "I was always training and playing with older kids who had much more experience than me. Many of them were bigger and faster than me too, so I had to beat them with my brain."[12] He admired Greek basketball player Vassilis Spanoulis from his early teenage years, stating that he was "enchanted" by him.[13] He wore the number 7 at Real Madrid in honor of Spanoulis.[14] Dončić also grew up admiring American basketball player LeBron James.[15]
                    Youth career
                    Union Olimpija
                    When Dončić was eight, his father started playing for his hometown club Union Olimpija, and Olimpija Basketball School coach Grega Brezovec invited Luka to practice with players of his age.[10][16] Dončić was initially expected to practice with players his age, but only 16 minutes into his first training session, the coaching staff moved him to the 11-year-old group. Starting in the next session, he primarily practiced with Olimpija's under-14 team, but due to league rules, he only played for the club's under-12 selection team, coming off the bench against opponents three or four years older than him.[10][12] Despite his exclusion from under-14 games at the time, Dončić often asked to attend practice, even when his coach asked him to stay home.[10]
                    Representing Olimpija at the under-14 Vasas Intesa Sanpaolo Cup in Budapest in September 2011, Dončić was named the most valuable player (MVP) despite finishing as runners-up to FC Barcelona.[17] In February 2012, he was loaned to Spanish club Real Madrid for the Minicopa Endesa, an under-14 Spanish club competition.[18][19] Dončić, who was among the youngest players on his team, averaged 13.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 3.3 steals per game to win tournament MVP honors, leading Real Madrid to a second-place finish.[19] In April 2012, he took part in the under-13 Lido di Roma Tournament for Olimpija, finishing as MVP and leading scorer with 34.5 points per game. In the semi-final round of the event against Victoria Fermo, he posted 29 points and 15 rebounds. In a title-clinching win over Lazio, he erupted for 54 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.[10][20]
